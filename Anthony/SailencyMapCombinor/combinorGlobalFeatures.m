function [ imageFeatures ] = CombinorGlobalFeatures( image, bag )
%COMBINORLOCALFEATURES Summary of this function goes here
%   Detailed explanation goes here
% imageFeatures should be a row vector [ 1 x numFeatures ]

  % placeholder features, but please don't remove
  % image = imresize(image, [200, 200]);
  % imageFeatures = [mean(mean(image(:, :, 1))), mean(mean(image(:, :, 2))), mean(mean(image(:, :, 3)))];
  % imageFeatures = [std2(image(:, :, 1)), std2(image(:, :, 2)), std2(image(:, :, 3)), imageFeatures];
  % gray = rgb2gray(image);
  % h = histogram(gray(:), 0:256 - 0.5);
  % imageFeatures = [h.Values, imageFeatures];

  % If you don't normalize resize so that the hisograms of larger images do not
  % have higher numbers than comparable smaller images
  imageFeatures = encode(bag, image, 'Normalization', 'L2');
