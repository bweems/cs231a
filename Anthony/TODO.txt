Train their combinator

Train a method that does per pixel saliency detection using (for features/input variables) the saliency maps produced as well as local pixel features and global features

Get the other data sets so that we can compare our results across other data sets

Things to plot: amount of training data versus error (AUC score)
They use Precision versus recall
They use True positives versus false positives
AUC scores (Area under the ROC curve) compares to other methods

ROC receiver operating characteristic
Precision corresponds to the percentage of salient pixels correctly assigned
recall is the fraction of detected salient pixels belonging to the salient object in the ground truth

They generated thePR curve by varying the threshold that determines whether a pixel is salient.
