The MSRA-A-SegmentationSaliencyMaps should contain all the saliency maps we will use
to train our saliency map combinor.  Each subdirectory in that folder contains all images
in the dataset with the saliency map produced according to a particular method of saliency.
Directories 1 to 15 are the saliency maps produced by segmenting the image and classifying the
saliency of each segment as was done in the DRFI codebase.  The same images should keep the same
name accross directories.
